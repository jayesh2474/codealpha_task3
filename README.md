## Introduction

Handwritten character recognition is a significant task in the field of computer vision, with applications ranging from automated form processing to historical document digitization. This project aims to develop a model capable of recognizing and interpreting handwritten characters, which can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize and augment the input data for better model accuracy.
- **Model Development:** Implement and train a neural network to recognize handwritten characters.
- **Word Recognition:** Extend the character recognition model to recognize and predict entire words or sentences.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the model's predictions and the impact of various preprocessing techniques.

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayesh2474/codealpha_task3.git
   cd codealpha_task3
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the dataset of handwritten characters.
- **Model Training:** Train the neural network on the preprocessed data.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict handwritten characters, words, or sentences.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly recognized characters.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualize the accuracy of predictions across different characters.
- **Loss/Accuracy Curves:** Track the model's training process over epochs.
